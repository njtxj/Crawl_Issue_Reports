rest(""/test"").get().type(ClassA.class).to(""direct:someRoute"");

rest(""/testSub"").get().type(ClassB.class).to(""direct:someOtherRoute"");



And in the type ClassA contains a reference to ClassB.

Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected:


/test:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA'



However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme

 
/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
             type : 'string'
             format : 'com.ClassB'



However I'd expect it to be:


/testSub:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB'","ASF GitHub Bot:1481727356:14/Dec/16 14:55:GitHub user bobpaulin opened a pull request:
